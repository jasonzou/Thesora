 - Versioning control 
 - Visualization support?
 - Generate metadata for each thesaurus including some statistics – Linked Data/support LDP
 - Run as a standalone thesaurus; can be connected to a repository?

 - Search
 - Sparql endpoint


VocBench
---------
The objective of enabling a quicker, dataset independent, setup and providing a collaborative platform for the management of SKOS-XL thesauri.

Schemes module to enhance multi scheme management and develop several skos:ConceptSchemes for the same dataset, providing different views on the data.

Statistics module to provide statistical information about the loaded data.

Export module to export the whole or a part of the content of a project.

Load data module to load bulk data serialized in some RDF serialization standard.

SPARQL module to query/update content directly through the SPARQL query language for RDF.

Ontology Import Management to owl:import ontologies to be used as property

vocabularies for the modelled thesauri.

New tabs under the concept view for covering extensively the SKOS-XL standard (Note, Notations, Scheme).
